### WHY AND WHAT TO TEST

These days, an increasing number of individuals and organizations are fighting for the top spot in app downloads. While many believe an app’s success depends on the type of program and its capabilities – and some of it does – the real difference between an app that sells and one that doesn’t is testing.

Forbes contributor Tom Taulli noted that in today’s landscape, it’s not just about having a “cool” application; users are more likely to abandon a program if it has functionality problems, no matter how promising it seems. Even the simplest apps can be lucrative for an organization if they work correctly.

“About half of the poor reviews on app stores are based on issues like crashes, network performance and battery drain,” said Jay Srinivasan, application development expert.

Mobile app testing provides the answer to these issues and can help developers prevent program failure.

#### What app elements should be tested?

However, knowing that testing should take place and be able to determine what to test are two very different things. It can be a challenge to determine the specific elements that need to be tested, as if any of these critical aspects are missed, the app could prove to be a misstep. The Next Web contributor Abhimanyu Ghoshal noted that there are several main areas which should be tested, as well as different features under each category.

For example, functionality testing should happen at the beginning. Functionality tests should include checks for customer submission forms and the search feature. Additionally, developers should also examine media components such as audio and video playback, the compatibility of scripts and libraries, and any manipulations or calculations that the app may carry out.

“Users expect apps to function accurately, quickly and consistently,” Ghoshal wrote. “That means you have to kick the tires on everything that helps a user achieve a result of some sort.”

Ghoshal also recommended several areas to test for user interface and usability. These include app navigation, cross-browser capability, help features, error messages and alerts, as well as the general layout of the program. These assessments will ensure “a quality front-end experience for all your users,” Ghoshal stated.
