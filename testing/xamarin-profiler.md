Profiling is helpful in all types of development, but it is especially crucial in mobile development. Unoptimized code is much more noticeable on mobile platforms than on desktop computers, and the success of your app depends on beautiful and optimized code that runs efficiently.

The Xamarin Profiler provides developers with a way to profile their Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS applications from inside Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio. The profiler collects and displays information about the app, which can then be used by the developer to analyze an application’s behavior. There are a number of different ways to profile an application with the Xamarin Profiler, namely memory profiling and statistical sampling.
