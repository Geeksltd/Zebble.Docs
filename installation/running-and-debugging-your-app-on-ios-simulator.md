### RUNNING AND DEBUGGING YOUR APP ON IOS SIMULATOR

If you want to run the iOS app in the simulator on your window machine, you need to:

1. Download the Remoted iOS Simulator from the following address:

https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/windows/ios-simulator/

2. In Visual studio open Xamarin mac agent and connect to the mac you already made ready for Xamarin development.

3. In "Solution Platforms" drop-down list in Visual Studio select iPhoneSimulator and from the list of devices select the type of the device you need to test the app on.

4. Run the app with debugging. It will open a simulator windows and run the app in it.

 
**Note:**

* If the version of Xamarin installed on your machine is different from the version installed on the Mac you will face problems doing this. Make sure the versions are right

* Do not close the simulator windows every time that you stop debugging.
