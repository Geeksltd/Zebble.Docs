### WHY ZEBBLE?

Zebble is a product that brings .NET/C# to Windows, Android and iOS. Zebble is pretty amazing in that it's fully .NET while being able to produce true Windows, Android and iOS apps at the same time.

If all that doesn't perk your interest in Zebble, here are five reasons you should be using Zebble, for your Windows, iOS and Android cross-platform development.

 

#### 1. Less to learn
Becoming an effective mobile application developer always involves a learning curve. There are things like process lifecycle, UI norms, the platform SDK, etc. that one must learn. Why add one or more programming languages to the already lengthy list of things you must learn?

If you're an experienced .NET/C# developer you will be immediately at home working with Zebble. It provides a complete implementation of C# and incredibly thorough implementation of the .NET class libraries.

Even if you're not an existing .NET/C# developer, Zebble will likely reduce the time you spend learning. Android and iOS normally require the use of two separate programming environments: Java and Objective-C respectively. Very few developers are highly skilled in both of these environments which means the overwhelming majority of developers will have to learn one or both of these environments before beginning a cross-platform project.

Learning the Java and Objective-C environments is not limited to just the programming languages. There's also the issue of the underlying core classes such as collections, etc. that will require you to understand two different ways of doing the same things.

Using Zebble, you only need to learn one language, C# and markup.

 

#### 2. No limits
One of the coolest aspects of Zebble is that it doesn't try to force commonality where none exists. Both Android and iOS have UI and SDK features that are distinct to each platform's appearance and behavior. These features are central to iOS apps feeling like iOS and Android apps feeling like Android.

Some cross-platform application development tools attempt to hide platform uniqueness which results in apps feeling foreign to the platform on which they're run. Zebble does just the opposite. Zebble embraces the unique features of each platform.

In addition to the standard .NET classes, Zebble includes iOS-specific .NET classes and Android-specific .NET classes, each of which expose the unique features of their respective platform. The combination of the core .NET classes with the platform-specific classes allows applications to share core logic across both iOS and Android while taking advantage of the each platform's unique features.

 

#### 3. Faster time-to-market
Zebble allows us to code application logic once and then share it across both iOS and Android. Compare this to working in the native environments of the two platforms where the logic must be implemented once in Java for Android then the same logic implemented a second time in Objective-C for iOS.

Put simply, using each platform's native development environment requires that we write more code. Writing more code takes more time. With Zebble we're able to focus our efforts on building app features once and then shipping the app. Compare this to the native platform environments where we build the app features once for one platform, then we build them again for the other platform, and then finally we ship.

A quick note on the issue of time-to-market. Zebble definitely reduces development time but I don't want to give the impression that it cuts development time in half. We still write some code that is unique to each platform such as when creating the UI or interacting with platform-specific features.

 

#### 4. Fewer bugs
The number one reason that Zebble tends to result in fewer bugs is the same reason that it provides faster time-to-market: we write less code. As a general rule, the less code we write the fewer errors we're likely to commit.

Zebble also reduces errors by providing the opportunity for greater test coverage. Any given project has a finite amount of time available for testing. Rather than spending that time writing two sets of largely duplicate tests, we can write a single, more comprehensive set of tests that validate the code for both platforms.

Finally there's the issue of skills concentration. Working in the native development environments requires that one of two things happen. In one case, each developer on a team must split their time between the two environments providing less opportunity to become proficient in either environment. The alternative is to split the team so that each developer focuses on one platform or the other. The problem here is the team becomes artificially divided with each team member being limited to supporting and checking only those team members who work on the same platform.

With Zebble, the whole team is able to focus entirely on working with .NET/C#. This allows each team member's skills to develop more fully and enables the team as a whole to better support and check one another.

 

#### 5. Readiness for the future
By using Zebble to create our iOS/Android apps, we can have our apps ready to support Windows Phone without investing a single second in developing for Windows Phone. All of the shared logic we create for our iOS/Android app will be fully supported by Windows Phone as long as we indicate we would like that to be the case when we first create the project. This allows us to build our app without investing any energy in Windows Phone development. However, should a Windows Phone opportunity present itself, all we have to do is create the Windows Phone UI and our app now supports three smartphone platforms instead of just two.

Zebble is gaining more attention everyday and with good reason. In a world where a variety of mobile platforms coexist, we need a toolset that allows us to support multiple platforms with minimal duplication of work. This just what we get with Zebble.
