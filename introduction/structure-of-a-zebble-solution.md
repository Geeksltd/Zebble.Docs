### STRUCTURE OF A ZEBBLE SOLUTION

When you create a new M# Xamarin project, a solution will be created from the template (see image). The following explains the different projects in the solution.

#### Application-specific code:


**App.Domain:** This is similar to the Domain project in your normal MVC projects. It contains the business logic entities and data access classes generated by M#. Also, you have your partial logic classes and service classes there. The code generated here by M# is almost identical to that of MVC projects.
 

**App.UI:** This project contains the code to define your application's user interface. The folders of Pages and Modules are generated by M#. All other folders are managed by yourself.

#### Run folder
This contains the executable projects for each platform. These are the only projects that actually get compiled into each native platform along with all the referenced shared projects. They each reference the Zebble nuget package.
