### INTRODUCTION OF GEO LOCATION

Geolocation is the identification or estimation of the real-world geographic location of an object, such as a radar source, [mobile phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone), or [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)-connected computer terminal. In its simplest form geolocation involves the generation of a set of [geographic coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) and is closely related to the use of [positioning systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_system), but its usefulness is enhanced by the use of these coordinates to determine a meaningful location, such as a [street address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_address).

Every place on earth can be identified by two simple numbers,

the [Longitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude) and [Latitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude). Geocode your position right now and for free.

**Longitude** is a [geographic coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface. It is an angular measurement, usually expressed in [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)) and denoted by the [Greek letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet) [lambda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda) (λ). Meridians (lines running from the [North Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole) to the [South Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole)) connect points with the same longitude. By convention, one of these, the [Prime Meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Meridian), which passes through the [Royal Observatory, Greenwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich), England, was allocated the position of zero degrees longitude. The longitude of other places is measured as the angle east or west from the Prime Meridian, ranging from 0° at the Prime Meridian to +180° eastward and −180° westward. Specifically, it is the angle between a plane containing the Prime Meridian and a plane containing the North Pole, South Pole and the location in question. (This forms a [right-handed coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-handed_coordinate_system) with the z axis (right hand thumb) pointing from the Earth's center toward the North Pole and the x axis (right hand index finger) extending from Earth's center through the equator at the Prime Meridian.)

In [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography), latitude is a [geographic coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) that specifies the [north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North)–[south](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South) position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run east–west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude) to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Without qualification the term latitude should be taken to be the geodetic latitude as defined in the following sections. Also defined are six auxiliary latitudes which are used in special applications.
