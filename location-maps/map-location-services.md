#### Map component

You can use the Zebble.Plugin.Map component to render a Map. It supports adding annotations too. You can add it to your project from nuget.

To use this component, install the [Zebble.Map](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Zebble.Plugin.Map/) nuget package. 
It's open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Geeksltd/Zebble.Plugin.Map). Also we welcome any contributions to enhace it.

#### Map Box
 
If the functionality provided by the native map components is not enough, then you can use the MapBox Plugin for Zebble which you can install from Nuget.

To install Map for Zebble for Xamarin, run the following command in the [Package Manager Console](https://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console)

To use this component, install the [Zebble.MapBox](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Zebble.Plugin.MapBox/) nuget package. 
It's open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Geeksltd/Zebble.MapBox). Also we welcome any contributions to enhace it.
